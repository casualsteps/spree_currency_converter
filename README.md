SpreeCurrencyConverter
======================

Will eventually include:

- Rake task to scrape http://www.customs.go.kr/kcshome/rate/ExchangeRateList.do for the latest official Korean government exchange rate and then save this in the database.
- Functionality to display prices in KRW that are stored in USD

Installation
------------

Add spree_currency_converter to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'spree_currency_converter'
```

Bundle your dependencies and run the installation generator:

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rails g spree_currency_converter:install
```

Testing
-------

First bundle your dependencies, then run `rake`. `rake` will default to building the dummy app if it does not exist, then it will run specs. The dummy app can be regenerated by using `rake test_app`.

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rake
```

When testing your applications integration with this extension you may use it's factories.
Simply add this require statement to your spec_helper:

```ruby
require 'spree_currency_converter/factories'
```
